This Commutator allows https connections to be served by programs not originally designed for this purpose. It automatically manages tls certificates on a dedicated port and then redirects http requests to a specified address.

PUBLIC_IP_COMM - public url needed to create Lets's Encrypt free tls certificate (required)
DEST_IP_COMM - ip or url to redirect http request
DEST_PORT_COMM - port to redirect http request
